Put the cider into a large saucepan, and add the oranges and some cinnamon sticks (one or two will do). Heat for hours (you can just leave it on all day for a party). It gets better with age. Just pour in more cider when it starts getting low.

Vegan - Hot indian "milk" drink
	-Soy milk
	-Ginger
	-Cloves
	-Cinnamon
	-Allspice
	-Sugar
Instructions: In a large cooking pot (at least twice the size needed to contain your soy milk), mix everything together and heat on high while stirring constantly. Bring to a boil (remember to stir constantly!), and the concoction will froth up. Remove from heat, let the froth subside, and repeat this cycle three more times. This is why your pot has to be bigger: the frothing would cause a major spill if you used a smaller pot. Serve and drink while hot. You can also adjust sweetness in your cup. Some people may want to strain this, as the ground spices sometimes have some coarse particles. This is a very nice hot drink, with a definite indian-food flavour, spicy-sweet and rich. The original recipe using milk also called for a tablespoon of butter for each serving (yuk!), and that was intended to make the drink rich-tasting. The thicker soy milk already has that thick rich texture, and is much lower in fat content.

	-Ice
Instructions: First and foremost, BUY A NEW GARBAGE CAN, and wash it out thoroughly!!!!! (Preferably the big ones 40-55gal). First Pour in all of the Grain (10 bottles of 1.75ml [Handle]), keep in mind that this recipie is for a Large Party, not 10 people sitting around getting loaded.....Anyway, next add the dry packets of mix. We used to get the largest industrial bags we could, don't go for quality, you're not going to remember anyway. Now this is the most critical part, the fruit. This is why I put this on here...any joker can make punch, but I figured I would distibute my years of fruit research for free....the Best friends you have in the Fruit community are the Orange and the Apple. This is because they absorb the grain better than anything else I tested. So make sure you get some of these in every glass you get, and eat them, DON'T EVER THROW THESE OUT, this is the best part of the drink. Bananas suck, they get gushy, watermellon works ok but the seeds get to be a pain in the ass when you can't see so well, pineapple is good, basically you get the point. Cut the fruit into wedges and throw it in the mix and let it sit around for a minute...Now throw in the bags of ice and fill it up to desired potency with water, mixing can be done with a canoe paddle or a 2x4 or anything else you've got lying around...a disposable camera is usually a good partner while drinking this concoction, people get really outta hand and go off the deep end.....This goes well as an iceblock shot too.

If you want you can stir now (in that case the above directions are void) - but i prefer not to. Now's the time for the red wine. It doesn't have to be anything special: I tend to use a Lambrusco because of the pearliness, also the amount of wine you use will affect the taste of the drink immensely. I use between 1/2 cl to 1 cl, not more, other wise the tatse of the wine will dominate too much. To get your optimal taste you'll just have to experiment a little back and forth.
